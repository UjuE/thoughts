This has been a long time coming; finally it is here.

I am software developer and a lover of most things tech.
I have had many "lives" in this career of mine, all within technology, but I have lived the longest as a dev.

Currently, I am advancing my skills in Software Security, so forgive me if more of my posts are on this subject.

Loads of fun times ahead (at least for me :D).
