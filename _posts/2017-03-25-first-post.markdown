I am a professional procrastinator.

I made a great plan. Over 6 years ago I planned to catalog everything I learn as I learn it. The aim was to use it as a way to review my progress year on year.

Oh I had great plans, I made lists of all the things I would learn, created a learning schedule and 6 years later, nothing.
