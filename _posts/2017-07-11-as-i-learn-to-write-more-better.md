Writing scientific papers, blogs and documenting software is difficult for me. I find choosing the right words and using grammar properly to be quite a daunting task. I wonder what my life would be without spell-check.

The other day I wrote an entire document using the word "rouge" rather than "rogue". My trusted spell-check did not save me. Heart broken, I have decided I can no longer rely on my darling spell-check. I clearly needed more out of the relationship than it was willing to give me.
I clearly need a plan to become better and a way to measure my improvement over time. I could listen to more Grammar-girl podcasts and read more books on creative writing, write more, get other people to read my writing and score me, but I am very lazy.
So scratch the previous paragraph. I clearly need a LAZY plan to become better.

To get better I definitely have to write more. But, I would like to automate the process of checking my writing style. After reading "6 Automatic Editing Tools That Will Make Your Writing Super Clean" on https://thewritelife.com[1]⁠, I have decided I will use 2 approaches.
I would use Grammarly and log how many advanced errors it finds. I would also determine my score from the number of words the article has. Smaller pieces of writing should have reduced number of errors, at least that is the hope.
I will also use the Hemingway app to check and log how readable my writing is.

## Results
Grammarly found 12 advanced issues in that document. There are 21 sentences in that article, so the score is 5 (Score = (advanced issues / Number of sentences) * 10)
Hemingway graded it a 5.
